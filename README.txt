INVADERS II
I designed Invaders II as a three-level,
boss-filled game with power ups, enemies
with multiple lives firing back, sound effects, 
movement in various directions, death
animations, and random-spawn events (e.g.
the final boss having a chance to spawn 
spikey balls to attack you). Did I also 
mention that the power ups and spikey balls
spawn in random locations on the y=0 axis?
Kekeke...

For the purposes of clarifying what I wrote,
I built upon a few provided files; in particular,
the GameObj, GameCourt, and Game files. Note
that these files were bare bones when received and I 
added 99% of the code and logic to make them work. 
Finally, I had to read into documentation and
go to office hours (this was originally a final class proj)
for how to implement an opening screen with buttons
and whatnot. Regardless, all the game logic and other code
should be mine.  If there's any questions, just shoot
me an email for clarification.
